# Requirements
Developed with the following software in mind:
 - [Rainmeter 4.0 or later](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
 - [Python 3.5 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) \*
 
 \* Tick the checkbox on the first screen of the Python installer to add Python to the PATH system variable and make sure that **tkinter** is ticked in the section for optional features. The embeddable versions of Python do not include the **tkinter** module. The **Browse** buttons in the settings skin do nothing if the **tkinter** module is not present in the Python 3 environment. The rest of Lauhdutin should work just fine, but you will need to specify the absolute path to the **pythonw** executable in the settings menu. If you have multiple versions of Python installed (e.g. 2.7 and 3.5), then you may have to specify the absolute path to the **pythonw** executable for 3.5 in the settings menu if the system defaults to 2.7.

# Installing
- Install Rainmeter and Python 3 on your system (see [requirements](#requirements) for more info).
- Download a [release](https://github.com/Kapiainen/Lauhdutin/releases).
- Extract the **Lauhdutin** folder and place it in `\Rainmeter\Skins`.
- Load **Settings.ini**, adjust the various settings (e.g. path to Steam) to your liking, click the **Save** button, and finally click the **Exit** button.
- **Main.ini** should now load and will gather information on the games that you have installed. The skin will say **Processing...** for a while as it is e.g. downloading banners for games, but should eventually switch over to showing a list of games that it has found.
- Windows shortcuts (.lnk files) can be added to the `\Lauhdutin\@Resources\Shortcuts` folder.
- Banners for Windows shortcuts and Steam's Non-Steam game shortcuts can be added to the `\Lauhdutin\@Resources\Banners\Shortcuts` and `\Lauhdutin\@Resources\Banners\Steam shortcuts` folders, respectively. The name of the banner should match the name of the .lnk file or the name in Steam, respectively.

# Updating
If you are using an older version of Lauhdutin (2.0.0 or newer) and want to update to the latest version, then you have two recommended options:

- Remove the old version completely from `\Rainmeter\Skins` and then proceed with the [normal installation steps](#installing).
- Caution! You will lose:
  - All information regarding total time played that was tracked solely by **Lauhdutin**. Steam tracks this information independently for its games.
  - All settings (e.g. layout, Steam UserDataID, hidden games).

or

- Remove all files from `\Rainmeter\Skins\Lauhdutin` except for the following files and folders:
```
\Rainmeter\Skins\Lauhdutin\@Resources\games.json
\Rainmeter\Skins\Lauhdutin\@Resources\settings.json
\Rainmeter\Skins\Lauhdutin\@Resources\Banners
\Rainmeter\Skins\Lauhdutin\@Resources\Shortcuts
```
- If you are using a Python path that differs from the default value, then do not remove `\Rainmeter\Skins\Lauhdutin\@Resources\PythonPath.inc` either!
- If you are using custom icons (not referring to game banners), then do not remove `\Rainmeter\Skins\Lauhdutin\@Resources\Icons` either!
- Extract the latest version of Lauhdutin over the old version's remaining barebones folder. Do not overwrite `PythonPath.inc`, if you left it intact when removing files and folders. Do not overwrite any custom icons you may have been using either, if you were using custom icons for e.g. showing how games are being sorted.
- Load **Main.ini** in Rainmeter, right-click on the skin, go to **Custom skin actions**, and click on **Rebuild**.

# Filtering
The list of games can be narrowed down by applying a filter. A filter can just be the name, or a part of the name, of one or more games. There are also special filters:

- `steam:` followed by `true` or `false`. If `true`, then only show games installed via Steam. If `false`, then show all other games that were not installed via Steam.

- `galaxy:` followed by `true` or `false`. If `true`, then only show games installed via GOG Galaxy. If `false`, then show all other games that were not installed via GOG Galaxy.

- `installed:` followed by `true` or `false`.  If `true`, then only show are installed. If `false`, then show games that are not installed (only Steam games are supported at the moment).

- `hidden:` followed by `true` or `false`. If `true`, then only show games that are hidden.

- `tags:` followed by a value (e.g. `tags:rogue-like`). Supports tags assigned in *Steam*.

- `+` followed by a filter (e.g. `+bin` or `+tags:rogue-like`).

Filters can be applied by left-clicking on the magnifying glass in the toolbar, which becomes visible when you nudge the top of the skin. Filters can be removed by either right-clicking on the magnifying glass or by applying a blank filter.

# Changelog
**Version 2.2.0 - 2017/02/10:**
- Added support for tracking total amount of time played for most games. Will not work properly e.g. when the Battle.net client is opened instead of launching a game directly. Total time played is stored in `games.json`, which can be transferred from an older version to a newer version when updating. Supports Steam's time tracking, if a valid *SteamID64* value is specified in the settings.
- Added support for processing Steam community profiles for additional information on games (e.g. hours played). Feature can be disabled by leaving the new *SteamID64* setting blank.
- Added ability to show Steam games that are not installed. Games that are not installed are not shown by default, but they can be browsed via a context menu option or by filtering with `installed:false`. Filtering not-installed games further requires the `+` prefix. Clicking on a game that is not installed will start the normal installation process via Steam's browser protocol.
- Added context menu options for hiding and unhiding games. Toggle the corresponding option to start (un)hiding games and toggle the option again to stop. Hidden games are not shown by default, but they can be browsed via a context menu option or by filtering with `hidden:true`. Filtering hidden games further requires the `+` prefix.
- Added ability to filter out installed Steam games that the current Steam account does not have a license for. Requires that a non-blank and valid SteamID64 value is specified in the settings.
- Added highlighting to slots when the mouse is hovering over a slot. Feature can be disabled and modified via the settings menu.
- Added better handling of the scenario where no Steam games are installed, but games are discovered via the Steam community profile.
- Missing 'sharedconfig.vdf' and 'localconfig.vdf' should no longer cause no Steam games to be returned by the backend.
- Fixed bug that caused the Python path value to not be written to 'PythonPath.inc' during the initial setup.
- Fixed bug that caused certain Windows shortcuts to not show up due to not accepting valid paths that contained certain characters.
- Refactored Settings config to use relative positioning when possible.
- Refactored backend Python scripts to facilitate testing.
- Added tests for most of the Python backend scripts.
- Integrated running tests into the release process.
- Updated overlay for installing games.

**Version 2.1.0 - 2017/01/27:**
- Added strict minimum Python version check to backend.
- Added support for horizontal layout and a setting to toggle between vertical/horizontal layout.
- Added more messages for the status of the backend.
- Moved *Python* skin variable into a separate .inc file and added a setting for it.
- More information about backend exceptions are passed along to the skin to help with debugging and troubleshooting.
- Set UTF-8 as the encoding to use when reading files that were not generated by the skin.
- Added more print statements to the backend to help with debugging and troubleshooting.
- Fixed bug that caused the backend to return zero games from Steam despite finding more than zero games installed via Steam.

**Version 2.0.0 - 2017/01/26:**
- Implemented backend in Python 3:
    - Improved Steam support:
        - Non-Steam game shortcuts added to Steam are now fully supported and are run via the Steam browser protocol.
    - Added support for GOG Galaxy:
        - Can detect games installed via GOG Galaxy.
        - Can download banners automatically.
    - Added support for regular Windows shortcuts (.lnk).
        - Shortcuts are placed in a specific folder and a corresponding banner can be provided in another folder by the user.
- Implemented frontend in Python 3 and Lua:
    - Added secondary skin, which is accessible from the primary skin, for adjusting settings.
        - Menu is capable of showing the Steam persona name linked with the UserDataID for easier configuration.
        - Support for directory dialog when *tkinter* module is available in Python 3 environment.

**Version 1.3.3 - 2016/11/29:**
- Updated the Lua script to more gracefully handle appmanifests that do not conform to the expected structure.
- Updated the section covering the UserDataID setting in the readme.

**Version 1.3.2 - 2016/11/22:**
- Updated the URL used to download banners for games on Steam since the previous URL became obsolete and no longer successfully downloaded banners.

**Version 1.3.1 - 2016/11/05:**
- Updated the VDF parser to process the keys of all key-value pairs in case-insensitive manner. This change should fix the issue of Steam games not showing up for some people.

**Version 1.3.0 - 2015/06/06:**
- Paths to Steam libraries, which exist outside of the folder where Steam is installed, are now automatically read from libraryfolders.vdf, which exists in the SteamApps folder located in the folder where Steam is installed. The SteamLibraryPaths setting is no longer used.

**Version 1.2.1 - 2015/05/03:**
- The toolbar should now hide itself so that it is out of the way when adding games to a skin that currently has no games to show.
- Modified the patterns used when parsing VDF files in order to handle values containing quotation marks.

**Version 1.2.0 - 2015/05/01:**

- New settings:
  - ToolbarLogoTint
  - AddGameButtonColor
  - AddGameButtonBackgroundColor

- Added support for additional Steam libraries that exist outside of the folder where Steam is installed.

**Version 1.0.1 - 2015/04/29:**
- Fixed a bug that caused the script to do unnecessary iterations in a for-loop that would result in an attempt to access a non-existing game object in the table of games.

**Version 1.0.0 - 2015/04/29:**
- Initial release.
